## Practice Statement: Score of Students

**The total marks of all the students of grade 12, irrespective of the stream opted by them has to be calculated. The subjects vary depending on their choice of stream.**

**For example**

- A student who has opted for the medical stream will get marks for math, physics, chemistry and biology
- A student who has opted for the non medical stream will get marks for math, physics and chemistry 
- A student who has chosen the commerce stream will get marks for business studies, finance and accounts


**Write a program with overloaded methods that will help calculate marks of the different streams of Grade 12 students.**

--Boilerplate--

```java
public class StudentMarks {

    /* adding 4 integer values.*/


    public int calculateMarks(int physics, int chemistry, int maths) {


        return -1;
    }

    /* adding 3 integer values.*/
    public int calculateMarks(int physics, int chemistry, int maths, int bio) {


        return -1;
    }

    /* adding 4 double values.*/
    public double calculateMarks(double physics, double chemistry, double maths, double bio) {


        return -1;
    }

    /* static method adding 5 float values.*/
    public static float calculateMarks(float maths, float bio, float physics, float chemistry, float lang) {


        return -1;
    }


    /* adding 4 float values with order changed.*/
    public float calculateMarks(float maths, float bio, float physics, float chemistry) {



        return -1;
    }

}


```

```java

class StudentMarksCalcImpl{

    public static void main(String []args){

        String stream;
        // Read stream value from user and marks for different subjects based on the stream selected

        // Display the total marks
        

    }


}


```
