#### Basic exercises on arrays

- Exercise 1: Create a method which accepts an integer array, reverse the numbers in the array and  returns the resulting array in sorted order 

##### Hints


arr = [201, 654, 23, 765]

output = [32, 102, 456, 567]

```java

int reverse(int num){
	...
}

int[] reverseArray(int[] arr){
 	int []output = new int[arr.length];
	
	...
	return output;

}


int[] sort(int[] arr){
	...
}

```

- Exercise 2: Create a class containing a method to create the mirror image of a String. The method should  return the two Strings separated with a pipe(|) symbol . 

- <b>Output - Hello | olleH</b>
- Exercise 3: Create a method which accepts an integer array and removes all the duplicates in the array.  Return the resulting array in descending order

## Practice Statement - Palindrome 

**Palindrome is a word, sentence or a number that reads the same even after its order is reversed. Harrah is one such palindrome town in Oklahoma, United States. For administrative purposes, a list of all palindrome towns and cities is being prepared.**
**Write a Java program that states whether the name of a place is a palindrome or not. Print the words and display their total count.**

**Sample Input**

    String words []= {"Hannah", "Texas", "Renner", "Eleele" }

**Expected Output**

    Hannah is a palindrome
    Renner is a palindrome

    Total number of palindromes: 2
